# Rally-Car-Time-Simulator-

This software simulates rally race times.
They are vary off of times that my friends and I got on courses we made in a game.

There is a guarenteed +/- 10 to default time
Random occurences in the times include:
Mistake
Flat Tire
Suspension Failure
Engine Malfunction
Brake Issues
Transmission Issues

Each one has a different probability of happening and different ranges of time.

TO USE:
open windows terminal (command prompt)
navigate to the file that main.exe is in (using "cd 'filename'" and "dir" to see files/folders in the folder you are currently in)
then run it by saying main.exe
